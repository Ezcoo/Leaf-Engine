# Leaf Engine

**Leaf Engine** is an addon free modular framework built on Arma 3 for building roleplaying missions. The logo represents both a leaf and a flame; the leaf reflects close connection to the vivid nature present in Arma games, while the flame reflects the gamemodes being fueled and powered by the engine.
